## :star: Inference
1. Download the traffic dataset from CODA website (https://coda-dataset.github.io);
2. 


## :trophy: Results
### Ablation studies
Table 1. Ablation studies of the effectiveness of each stage in the HCOENet. Stage1 refers the sentence split and key entity extraction, stage2 refers the entity cross-checking, stage3 refers the hallucination correction, stage4 refers the critical-object identification, stage5 refers the object description, and stage6 refers integrating descriptions from two frameworks. (\%)
